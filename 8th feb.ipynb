    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is the process of hiding unnecessary implementation details while showing only the essential features to the user.\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved by creating abstract classes and interfaces that define a set of methods or properties that must be implemented by the subclasses. \n",
    "The subclasses can then implement their own specific functionality while inheriting the abstract class's generic properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a car. \n",
    "A car is an abstraction of a complex machine that consists of various parts like an engine, wheels, gearbox, etc. \n",
    "However, when we drive a car, we do not need to know how these parts work or interact with each other. \n",
    "We only need to know how to use the car's basic features, such as steering, accelerating, braking, and changing gears. \n",
    "This is achieved through abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, we can create an abstract class called \"Vehicle\" that defines a set of methods like \"drive\", \"stop\", \"accelerate\", and \"turn\". \n",
    "These methods are generic and applicable to all vehicles like cars, trucks, bikes, etc. \n",
    "We can then create a subclass called \"Car\" that inherits the methods from the \"Vehicle\" class and implements its specific features like \"park\", \"reverse\", and \"change gears\". \n",
    "The user can now interact with the car through the methods defined in the \"Car\" class without worrying about the underlying details of how the car works. \n",
    "This is the essence of abstraction in OOP.\n",

    "\n",
    "Abstraction:-It provides a high-level view of an object or system, without going into the details of its internal workings.\n",
    "Encapsulation:- It provides a way to protect the internal data of an object from being modified or accessed by other objects directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:- It focuses on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",
    "Encapsulation:- It controls access to the internal state of an object through its public methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:- It simplifies the programming model and makes code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "Encapsulation:- It ensures that the internal state of an object is updated correctly, and prevents unexpected modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:- Examples include abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance.\n",
    "Encapsulation:- Examples include access modifiers such as public, private, and protected, as well as getter and setter methods.\n",
